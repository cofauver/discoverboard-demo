-Styling buttons for the input box
	-maybe make the bold button surround a the highlighted text with **'s
	-maybe italics button surrounds the highlighted text with _'s

-There is no "primary link" on any given post.

Just built color service. It might be better to have something like "StyleService" to 
hold all of the functions that relate to styling.
This might also be do-able in SASS



COMPLETED:

-Interaction id's are not registering properly. Tip interactions do not have the correct interactions ids
when I try to report

-Get summaries standardized

-Get Posts appearing on the recommended posts page
